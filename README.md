# Quaternion-based PID Guidance Software

Built and documented the making of a quaternion-based PID guidance software for model spacecraft.

### Introduction

This work aims to explore the means through which groups of four-dimensional hypercomplex numbers, namely quaternions, can express three-dimensional rotations, and build a quaternion-based PID guidance architecture to control a model spacecraftâ€™s attitude. My interest in this field originates from the building of an advanced model rocket I have been working on for over a year, which utilizes thrust vector control and avionics to re-orient itself. Moreover, quaternions are of great significance in advanced model rocketry and engineering due to the advantages they offer in contrast to other rotation systems, such as computational efficiency or problem minimization. Even more excitingly, this is an outstanding opportunity to apply complex numbers to real life problems. Additionally, the topic is not very well documented and often overlooked, setting a fun mathematical challenge.

Developing a quaternion-based guidance software requires a deep understanding of quaternions, hence, they will be studied through stereographic projections, scaling up from lower dimensions, to  understand how these express three-dimensional rotations. This knowledge will be subsequently  applied in combination with PID control theory to create a reliable attitude guidance software, tested and tuned using coded flight simulations.
